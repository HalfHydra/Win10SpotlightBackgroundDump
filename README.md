# Windows 10 Spotlight Background Dumper

If you have your lock screen on Windows 10 selected to use "Windows Spotlight", you see a brand new desktop background every morning. Since the file location is not in the easiest place to access, and you must rename the files to .png in order to see them, I created this to do it for me. It separates the mobile and desktop versions as well.

I used to do this manually, so I figured this was a minor task I could make something for.
